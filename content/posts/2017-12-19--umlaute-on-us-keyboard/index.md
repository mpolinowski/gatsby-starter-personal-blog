# Hacking your US keyboard

### Solving 1st World Problems by reading Usermanuals


I finally figured out how to write German Umlaute on an US keyboard, after studying the Windows 10 documentation for a while.

__tl;dr__ Switch your keyboard from ENG (US) or (UK) to ENG (International). Then type quotationmarks + the letter you want to change into an Umlaut.


```
"+a = ä
"+A = Ä
"+o = ö
"+O = Ö
"+u = ü
"+U = Ü
```

```
ALT+s = ß
```
