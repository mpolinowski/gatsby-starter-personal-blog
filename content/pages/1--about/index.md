## About me

My name is **Mike**. I am a science major with a strong foundation in Environmental and Atmospheric Chemistry. The instrumental analytic underlying those fields constantly confronted me long lists of unreadable data, badly designed interfaces and UX nightmares. Which is probably why I ended up wanting to learn techniques to handle these kinds of situations - **Full Stack Engineer** aspirations.


My current job allowed to get to know [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), powerful search engines like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and many more tools that enabled me to build a Knowledgebase Web Application - extracting Information from many sources and make them available with an responsive search interface.


## About this Blog

I am routinely working with open source libraries and I am active in open source communities - always trying to help, at least as much as I receive help and insights from talking to amazing web developers from all over the world.


This blog is based on my research and was originally just a collection of notes I used to guide me through my everyday work schedule. I wish that by opening this resource of knowledge, I can reach you and maybe help to solve a problem or two.
